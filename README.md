A complete **RESTful Web Services project** built with **Spring Boot**, **JPA/Hibernate**, and **PostgreSQL**, following a clean multilayer architecture and industry best practices.

This project covers the full construction of a production-grade backend API, from domain modeling to deployment.  
It includes:  
- Domain-driven design  
- Layered architecture (resource → service → repository)  
- JPA mappings, relationships, and ORM strategies  
- H2 test environment & PostgreSQL dev/prod environments  
- Database seeding and automatic initialization  
- Full CRUD operations  
- Exception handling with custom error responses  
- DTO patterns, pagination, and service-level validation  
- Preparation for cloud deployment (Heroku workflow)

The goal of this project is to solidify backend concepts using modern Java and Spring technologies, while building a scalable, structured, and maintainable web service architecture.
